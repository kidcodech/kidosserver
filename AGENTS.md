If asked to do sprint, work will be organized in 4 steps:
Before each step, ask if I want to proceed.

1. create user stories in specs/sprints/<n>/stories.md
   For story you need to know story and acceptance criteria.
   If user provided use that, if something is not clear clarify.

2. create plan in specs/sprints/<n>/plan.md
   Before creating plan, gather all information needed: how to implement, tech stack, nuances, constraints, etc.

3. create tasks in specs/sprints/<n>/tasks.md
   tasks are checklist items.

4. implement in code. After completing task item or joined group of items, mark task as done.

n is the sprint number, starting from 0001.
